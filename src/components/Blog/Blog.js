          1.What is the purpose of react router?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg">
          React Router, and dynamic, client-side routing, allows us to build a
          single-page web application with navigation without the page
          refreshing as the user navigates. React Router uses component
          structure to call components, which display the appropriate
          information. By preventing a page refresh, and using Router or Link,
          which is explained in more depth below, the flash of a white screen or
          blank page is prevented. This is one increasingly common way of having
          a more seamless user experience. React router also allows the user to
          utilize browser functionality like the back button and the refresh
          page while maintaining the correct view of the application.

          2.How does Context API work?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg">
          The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange
          unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of
          your application. The React Context API is a way for a React app to
          effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This
          is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent
          to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier,
          lighter approach to state management using Redux. It returns a
          consumer and a provider. Provider is a component that as it's names
          suggests provides the state to its children. It will hold the "store"
          and be the parent of all the components that might need that store.
          Consumer as it so happens is a component that consumes and uses the
          state.

          3.What is useRef hook in react?
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg">
          useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is
          initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object
          will persist for the full lifetime of the component. Essentially,
          useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current
          property. You might be familiar with refs primarily as a way to access
          the DOM. If you pass a ref object to React with myRef, React will set
          its .current property to the corresponding DOM node whenever that node
          changes. However, useRef() is useful for more than the ref attribute.
          It’s handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d
          use instance fields in classes. This works because useRef() creates a
          plain JavaScript object. The only difference between useRef() and
          creating a (current: ...) object yourself is that useRef will give you
          the same ref object on every render.
